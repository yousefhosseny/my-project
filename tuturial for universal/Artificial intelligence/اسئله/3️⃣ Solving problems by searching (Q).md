# Quick Recall Questions

### What is a simple reflex agent?

A simple reflex agent makes decisions based only on the current situation, without remembering past events.

### Give an example of a simple reflex agent.

A vacuum cleaner that cleans when it detects dirt but doesn’t remember where it has cleaned before.

### What are the main components of a simple reflex agent?

- Sensors: Detect the current situation.
- Condition-Action Rules: Determine actions based on conditions.
- Actuators: Perform the required action.

# True or False Questions

### A simple reflex agent can remember past states.

False

### A model-based reflex agent is more intelligent than a simple reflex agent.

True

### Goal-based agents only react without planning their actions.

False

### A utility-based agent chooses actions that maximize its benefit.

True

# Comparison Questions

### Compare a simple reflex agent and a model-based reflex agent.

A simple reflex agent only reacts based on the current situation, while a model-based reflex agent remembers past events and uses them for better decision-making.

### How does a goal-based agent differ from a utility-based agent?

A goal-based agent focuses on achieving a goal, while a utility-based agent considers different factors to make the best possible decision.

# Cause and Effect Questions

### Why is a simple reflex agent limited in decision-making?

Because it doesn’t store past information, it cannot adapt to dynamic or partially observable environments.

### What happens when a model-based agent uses past data?

It makes better decisions by considering previous experiences along with the current situation.

# Multiple Choice Questions

### Which of the following agents stores past information?

A) Simple Reflex Agent  
B) Model-Based Reflex Agent  
C) Goal-Based Agent  
D) Utility-Based Agent

**Answer:** B) Model-Based Reflex Agent

### A goal-based agent:

A) Reacts only to current conditions  
B) Stores past events  
C) Works based on achieving a specific objective  
D) Maximizes benefits in decision-making

**Answer:** C) Works based on achieving a specific objective

# Concept Questions

### What is the internal state in a model-based reflex agent?

The internal state stores past information to help the agent make better decisions.

### What is a utility function in a utility-based agent?

A utility function assigns value to possible actions to determine the best one.

# Fill in the Blanks

### A simple reflex agent makes decisions based only on the ______ situation.

**current**

### A model-based reflex agent uses ______ to remember past events.

**internal state**

### A utility-based agent chooses the action with the highest ______.

**utility value**

# Summary Question

### Summarize the key idea of a utility-based agent.

A utility-based agent selects the action that provides the highest benefit rather than just reaching a goal, making it more intelligent and adaptable.
