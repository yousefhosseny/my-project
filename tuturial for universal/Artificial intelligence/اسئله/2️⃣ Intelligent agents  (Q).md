# **Quick Recall Questions**

### **Q1:** What is the PEAS model in AI?

The PEAS model stands for **Performance, Environment, Actuators, and Sensors**. It is used to define the components of an intelligent agent.

### **Q2:** What is a rational agent in AI?

A rational agent is an entity that **chooses actions that maximize its performance based on its knowledge and environment**.

### **Q3:** Give an example of a partially observable environment.

A **self-driving car** operates in a partially observable environment because it cannot access all information about the road conditions at once.

### **Q4:** How does an AI agent perceive its environment?

An AI agent perceives its environment using **sensors** that collect data and provide input for decision-making.

### **Q5:** What makes an AI environment dynamic?

An environment is dynamic if **it changes while the agent is making decisions**, like a multiplayer online game.

# **True or False Questions**

### **Q1:** AI agents always work in fully observable environments.

**False.** Many AI systems operate in **partially observable** environments where they lack complete information.

### **Q2:** A chess-playing AI operates in a stochastic environment.

**False.** Chess is a **deterministic** game since the outcome of a move is entirely predictable.

### **Q3:** An intelligent agent always follows pre-defined rules.

**False.** AI agents can learn and adapt using **machine learning** rather than just following fixed rules.

### **Q4:** Sensors in AI are only used for vision-based systems.

**False.** Sensors collect various data types, including sound, temperature, and motion.

### **Q5:** The environment of a stock market prediction AI is static.

**False.** The stock market is **dynamic and unpredictable**, making it a challenging environment for AI.

# **Comparison Questions**

### **Q1:** Compare a Fully Observable vs. Partially Observable Environment in AI.

In a **fully observable** environment, the agent has access to all relevant information (e.g., chess).
In a **partially observable** environment, some information is hidden (e.g., a self-driving car).

### **Q2:** What is the difference between a Stochastic and Deterministic Environment?

A **stochastic** environment has randomness and uncertainty (e.g., poker), while a
**deterministic** environment has predictable outcomes (e.g., solving a math equation).

# **Explain Why & Consequences**

### **Q1:** Why is a dynamic environment challenging for AI?

A dynamic environment **changes over time**, requiring AI to continuously adapt, making decision-making more complex.

### **Q2:** What would happen if an AI agent could not perceive its environment?

The agent **would be unable to make informed decisions**, leading to ineffective actions or complete failure in performing tasks.
